                    Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes which bite between dusk and dawn. P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent, and P. falciparum is the most dangerous, with the highest rates of complications and mortality. This deadly form of malaria is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. People infected with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness at first. Left untreated, the disease can lead to severe complications and, in some cases, death.

                <p>
                The number of malaria cases globally fell from an estimated 262 million in 2000 (range: 205–316 million), to 214 million in 2015 (range: 149–303 million), a decline of 18%. <span class="emphasis">Most cases in 2015 are estimated to have occurred in the WHO African Region (88%)</span>, followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (10%) and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (2%).
                <br /> 
                <br /> 
                The number of malaria deaths globally fell from an estimated 839,000 in 2000 (range: 653 000–1.1 million), to 438 000 in 2015 (range: 236 000–635 000), a decline of 48%. <span class="emphasis">Most deaths in 2015 were in the WHO African Region (90%)</span>, followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (7%) and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (2%). The malaria mortality rate, which takes into account population growth, is estimated to have decreased by 60% globally between 2000 and 2015.

                <p>Global financing for malaria control increased from an estimated US $960 million in 2005 to US $2.5 billion in 2014. <span class="emphasis"> To address remaining challenges in global malaria control and elimination, WHO has developed the Global
Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030.</span> Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the strategy
provides a technical framework for all endemic countries as they work towards malaria control and elimination.
This Global Technical Strategy sets ambitious but achievable goals for 2030, including: reducing malaria case
incidence by at least 90%; reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90%; eliminating malaria in at least 35
countries; preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free. <span class="emphasis">To achieve these targets,
annual funding for malaria will need to triple over the next 15-year period,</span> from US$ 2.7 billion (current level of
spending) to US$ 8.7 billion by 2030.</p>
