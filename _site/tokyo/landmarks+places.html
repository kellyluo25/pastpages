                    Tokyo is a mix of the new and the old. The city couples modern skyscrapers and tall skylines with quainter scenes of Shinto temples and cherry blossoms. Mount Fuji lingers in the background, a towering presence that does not go unnoticed. Places in the capital city inherently complement one another. Urban areas bustle with activity, whereas quieter places of nature offer respite in busy lives.

                        The Tokyo subway is part of Tokyo’s sprawling transportation network. The rapid transit system consists of  Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway and is primarily contained within the center of the city. Parts of the line also extend out to suburban areas in the outskirts of Tokyo. The entire subway system functions on 285 stations and 13 lines. The subway was originally developed in the year 1927 with a single line in operation and has expanded to the thirteen lines functional today. The subway map indicates just how intertwined Tokyo’s subway system is; the nature of the Tokyo subway system is an attraction and feat in itself.

                        Mount Fuji is an active volcano located just outside of the Tokyo area. The massive, towering volcanic structure can be seen from the Tokyo city skyline. In Japanese, Mount Fuji is also known as Fuji-san. Mount Fuji looms over Tokyo’s inhabitants, ready to erupt at any moment, although the last eruption dates back to the early Eighteenth Century. It is a perilous thought that has inspired much of the art that has come out of the region. The cone of the volcano is topped with snow for much of the year. Mount Fuji is a breathtaking sight of nature that draws in crowds from natives and sightseers alike.
