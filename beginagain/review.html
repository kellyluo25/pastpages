                <span class="italic">Begin Again</span> is set against the lush backdrop of New York City, the film captures the vibrancy of the city in a slow lull as well as what it truly means to make music. The indie film is a radiant exploration of creativity and character, melding beautiful music with a rich setting to tell a story rooted in atmospheric sounds. It reexamines artistry in its most musical form through the intertwined presence of music and songwriting in the lives of all the central characters. The film also explores the need for connection and intimacy, zeroing in on the value of relationships in a changing, fast-paced world. The relationships are not only romantic, but also familial and friendly. The characters and relationship carry a high degree of relatability because their emotional core is grounded in reality; they are ordinary people trying to pursue what they love and music is their first love. <span class="italic">Begin Again</span> is poignant and evocative both as a film and also as a soundtrack. It is a bright call for new beginningsâ€”and beginning once again.

                <span class="italic">Begin Again</span> was well received by most critics and reviewers. The film currently has a 83% rating on Rotten Tomatioes, a Metacritic rating of 62, and a IMDb rating of 7. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/begin-again-20140626" title="Rolling Stone 'Begin Again' Review">Rolling Stone</a> gave <span class="italic">Begin Again</span> three out of four stars, citing its strength in "winning you over by not overplaying its hand, allowing some feelings to go unexpressed." Writer Peter Travers provides the a description that drives at the essence of the movie, an elegant description of what the musical-drama film does best: "It's rare to find a movie that uses music to define love without sentimentalizing it. But Begin Again, with songs by Glen Hansard and New Radicals frontman Gregg Alexander, is a wonderfully appealing exception." Similarly, Peter Debruge of <a href="http://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/toronto-film-review-can-a-song-save-your-life-1200603577/" title="Variety 'Begin Again' Review">Variety</a> enthused the loveliness of the film. A review during the film's initial premier at the Toronot International Film Festival, it cheekily hints at Begin Again's original title in saying "Perhaps the real title to 'Once' director John Carney's latest should be, 'Can Keira Knightley sing?' Happily, the answer is 'yes.'" Debruge comments, again, on the power of music within the film. Alternatively, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-begin-again-review-20140627-column.html" title="The Lost Angeles Time 'Begin Again' Review">The Los Angeles Times</a> had a less positive outlook. Kenneth Turan stated that the story and performances were subpar and the film was less impressive compared to Carney&#39;s previous musical film Once. Although he puts forth the film itself was bland, he still praises the powerful music behind the screen. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/movies/begin-again-from-the-once-director-john-carney.html" title="The New York Times 'Begin Again' Review">The New York Times</a> made a similar comment in that Begin Again was a "disappointing, overly produced follow-up to Once, " yet still maintained the film was kind of enjoyable." Even if critic opinions vary, <span class="italic">Begin Again</span> still feels like a breath of fresh air.
