						<h1>food + drink.</h1>
				<p>TThe landscape of cuisine in Tokyo best demonstrates how Japan offers great depth in its food variety and creativity with common food staples of rice, noodles, and fish. Sushi is the most universally well-known symbol of Japanese cuisine on the international front; however. More traditionally, matcha green tea plays a very prominent role in culture and customs such as the famed tea ceremony.</p>

						<p>
                            Japanese cuisine is traditionally based on rice, miso soup, and the inclusion of other seasonal ingredients. There is emphasis placed on seasonal ingredients and freshness. Rice is a common food staple, but noodles is another popular grain eaten throughout the nation. Soba buckwheat noodles and udon thick wheat noodles are the most common varieties of noodles. Since Japan is composed of islands and completely surrounded by water, its people have taken advantage of their surrounding natural resources. Fish and seafood provide much of the needed protein in Japanese dishes.

						<p>
                           Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. They commonly feature flavors based on red bean paste or matcha. The green tea matcha flavor has more recently taken root in modern iterations of Japanese sweets. Tokyo, in particular, is a hub for modernized Japanese desserts; many recent dessert innovations have come out of the capital city.

						<p>
                           Japanese drinks and beverages cover a wide spectrum. Tea is by far the most important drink staple in the island nation. Some drinks fare on the sweeter side, sugary carbonated beverages specifically marketed toward kids. They often feature anime characters or kawaii packaging to appeal to younger sensibilities. More alcoholic drinks targeted to adults include sake and beer as a more common drink option.

                    <h3>tea ceremony</h3>
                     <p class="teaintro">The tea ceremony is a time-honored tradition in japan, a cultural activity otherwise known as "the way of tea." The ceremony honors tea in its many forms and is a demonstration of respect and proper etiquette. In Japanese, the custom is known as chanoyu and may last for several hours. Many tea houses around Tokyo are designated areas that still practice the long standing procedures for conducting a tea ceremony. The steps may seem lengthy and a bit involved to the unfamiliar, but extremely important and provide a rejuvenating experience: 
</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li> 
                             The host pepares for the ceremony in advance by sending out invitations, finding the proper tools, cleaning the tea room venue, and choosing the teas
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             The guests arrive and do not enter until the host is ready for them to enter the tea room
                         </li>
                         <li> 
                             The host dilligently cleans the tea ceremony tools in front of the guests to initate the start of the ceremony
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             The matcha is added in the tea bowl to the proportion of three scoops of matcha per guest; hot water is added and the matcha is gently whisked together
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             The matcha tea is served as the guests pass around the tea bowl until it reaches the host once more
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             The hosts and guests bow to signal the end of the tea ceremony
                         </li>
