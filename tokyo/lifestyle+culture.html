                            The Japanese hold themselves to a strong sense of etiquette that dictates social order and behaviors. The bow is a form of showing respect, remorse, or used as a general greeting. Various degrees of bowing correspond to various displays of respect. Taking off footwear is another customary thing to do in Japan. It is especially important to do so when entering one’s private homes. Most customs are rooted in the idea of respect and showing deference to higher authority.
